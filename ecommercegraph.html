Only 10% of Indian MSMEs (Miro Small and Medium Enterprises) have embraced <br> e-commerce. For those who have, they have experienced increased sales, profitability, <br> and market penetration. However, for the remaining 90%, the rise of digital commerce <br> is not an opportunity, but a threat. On one hand, MSMEs that have integrated into <br> digital platforms are reaping significant benefits. A striking 35.5% of e-commerce <br> integrated MSMEs reported a turnover between Rs 10 million and Rs 500 million <br> in the 2021-22 financial year. Contrastingly, only 15.6% of non-integrated MSMEs <br> achieved this scale of turnover. <br><br>
The lack of technology adoption can limit the ability of MSMEs to innovate, optimise <br> their operations, and scale their business. Sometimes, MSMEs often face challenges <br> in accessing technology due to the high cost of investment, lack of awareness, and <br> limited technical expertise.
